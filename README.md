## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Data Manipulation, to achieve the expected result had to learn to filter info, compare variables based on element choosal, implement theme toggle. Obviously I can improve it by refactoring my code, but I'm satisfied on how much my knowledge has increased.

### Continued development

Prevent timeloss on html structure, assimilate project objectives, as displaying sizes, and how to assembly making it easier.
